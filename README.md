SmartyPlugins
=============

SmartyPlugins is a repository for unofficial Smarty plugins. 

It was created to provided a common room for all Smarty plugins out there in the wild. Each plugin included should be fully documented and, where possible, accompanied by a test suite to ensure code quality and stability.

This project also includes a new architecture, based on OO paradigm, called **Extensions**. An Extension is a PHP class that groups several related `plugins` and `filters`, meant to deliver a common feature like translations or a Google Maps API for instance.
